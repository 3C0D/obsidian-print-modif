## Features

- **Command Palette Action**: Activate the print action via the Command Palette.
- **Printer Ribbon Icon**: Activate the print function quickly with the printer icon.
- **Direct Print**: Skip the print modal and send your document directly to the default printer.
- **Debug Mode**: Open the print window with your notes content to troubleshoot and adjust styling issues.

You can also add a shortcut to the print action for even quicker access.

## Getting Started

The plugin has been submitted to the community plugin store, but due to a backlog, it might take some time before it becomes available. Meanwhile, you have two ways to install the plugin: manually or via BRAT.

### Option 1: Install via BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)

BRAT is a tool that allows you to install and manage plugins that are not yet available in the Obsidian community store. To install the plugin via BRAT:

1. Install the BRAT plugin from the community plugin store if you haven't already.
2. Once BRAT is installed, open the settings in Obsidian and navigate to the BRAT settings tab.
3. Under "Add a beta plugin for testing," paste the following repository URL: `https://github.com/marijnbent/obsidian-print`.
4. Click "Add Plugin."
5. The plugin will now appear under your installed plugins. Enable it and start printing!

### Option 2: Manual Installation

You can also install the plugin manually by following these steps:

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/marijnbent/obsidian-print/releases/latest) page and download these three files: `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and `main.js`.
2. In your Obsidian plugins directory, create a new folder called `obsidian-print`.
3. Move the downloaded files into the `obsidian-print` folder.
4. Thatâ€™s it! Enable the plugin in Obsidian and start printing.

## Roadmap

If you would like to contribute, please get in touch or make a pull request!

## Customize CSS

In the settings, you can adjust the font size for all headings and text, and optionally hide the title.

To further customize the appearance of your printed notes, you can create a `print.css` snippet. The printed document's body contains the `.obsidian-print` class. Be sure to prefix your print-specific CSS with this class so that it only applies to printed content. You can view the default styles [in this file](/styles.css).

If you have trouble with the styling, enable Debug Mode to preview how your notes will look when printed and make any necessary adjustments.
